# movieland-mern

Hi there...This is my movieland-mern stack app.

I did almost 60% including all backend part by myself but 40% for css/frontend part I need to revisit video tutorial "Build a Watchlist Using the MERN Stack | React, TMDB API, Express, MongoDB Tutorial 
(2023) from AlfredWebDev youtube channel". My frontend skill is still sucked. Sorry for that. But backend part for this app i did by myself almost 100% and  aslo a bit different from this video tutorail.

Also backend part for this app is  a bit confusing or a bit complicated. But I will  do again this app till I can do all backend and frontend 100% by myself without any help.

Also when I was deploying  this appin Netlify.com , there is some problems with my github repo and i am still trying to fix it. I need to learn how to deploy mern stack app asap.

You can  create and add your favorite movie list by using IMDB movie database movie id number. Then save this movies data in mongodb databse collection .
Below is the  images of app.
